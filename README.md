### Mod 03 Challenge: Password Generator

## Challenge Description:
This challenge started with a password generator webpage that was nonfunctional. The script.js file started with enough code to update the html once the password generation was functional.

## Functionality:
Clicking on the generate password button will prompt users to enter their desired password length between 8 and 128.
If a value outside that range is entered, it will request the user to enter a different value.
Four prompts will then appear asking which character types that they want to include.
If none are selected, it will restart and ask the user to select at least one.
After selection is finished, the password will generate and be visible to the user.
Clicking on the generate password button will generate a new password, erasing the old one.
